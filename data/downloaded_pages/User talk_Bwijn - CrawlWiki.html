<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_unbelievable_incident_of_the_crawler.27s_week">The unbelievable incident of the crawler's week</span></h2>
<p>A) Just a pesky "vamp mosquito" experience of raven tar black developer's viciousness: You can cast <a href="/Apportation" title="Apportation">Apportation</a> to pull items towards yourself that turn out to be item mimics in the very moment they bite you. I had supposed those were just perfect delusions. But no, they have nearly no weight/mass but a powerful biting. - On the other hand I just stumbled upon a <a href="/Potion_of_experience" title="Potion of experience">potion of experience</a> lying around at <a href="/The_Vaults" title="The Vaults">Vault</a>:2. Which one is the more surprising incident? -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 18:51, 24 February 2013 (CET)
</p><p>B) Which sort of mini <a href="/Vault" title="Vault">vault</a> could it be if you encounter on D:16 a gang of 5 humans, a wizard and a necromancer? (Each single might not be a bad challenge.) Have you seen anything like that? -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 20:33, 18 March 2013 (CET)
</p>
<dl><dd>The gang of five humans isn't too uncommon. I'm pretty sure that they can appear in small packs like that naturally. The wizard and necromancer, I'm not so sure about. Were there any unusual structures nearby? --<a href="/User:MoogleDan" title="User:MoogleDan">MoogleDan</a> 20:38, 18 March 2013 (CET)
<dl><dd>Yeah, a stone walled 8x4 structure (temple?) to the left and a normal rock walled 3x2 fields chamber (treasure? barracks?) to the right. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 20:44, 18 March 2013 (CET)
<dl><dd>That's not reminding me of any PARTICULAR vault, but if you have any scrolls of magic mapping lying around, I'd suggest you use one just to see what's inside. --<a href="/User:MoogleDan" title="User:MoogleDan">MoogleDan</a> 20:49, 18 March 2013 (CET)
<dl><dd> None at hand. By the way the fighting abilities of a band of six humans surpass my SpAK capability to win. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 20:54, 18 March 2013 (CET)</dd>
<dd>It was just the entry hall to the Vaults staircase. No vault guards but a simple band of "humans" guarding it. And I had never before encountered such a "common" gang. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 10:51, 23 March 2013 (CET)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>C) What a shocking scenery: I come around a corner and see the gateway to a bazaar. On three sides there are stone walls. The only entrance is occupied by a <a href="/Silver_statue" title="Silver statue">silver statue</a>. Damned! No <a href="/Wand_of_disintegration" class="mw-redirect" title="Wand of disintegration">wand of disintegration</a> available because this SpAK despite XL15 never ever found such a wand. If you'd flee the bazaar would be lost. Just by luck a <a href="/Ring_of_teleport_control" title="Ring of teleport control">ring of teleport control</a> and a scroll of blinking and another to teleport are investable. So I've found a solution. *grin* -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 10:51, 23 March 2013 (CET)
</p><p>D) It never before was as dangerous as in 0.11.2 to explore Orcish Mines:4. I've met lots of simple orcs who carried axes of <a href="/Distortion" title="Distortion">distortion</a>. Never in 0.10.3 I saw anything comparable. No, it's not the ever possible one random case, it's sort of a feature to make it "hotter" in the Mines. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 19:02, 27 March 2013 (CET) 
</p><p>E) What a chasm of maliciousness is this BullshitMinivault I found at D:17. <a href="/Wall" title="Wall">Walls</a> of green crystal, translucent and normal stone prevent anyone who is not an earth magician (shatter, Lee'S rapid deconstruction) to get the randart double sword inside. Malicious design! -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 02:56, 8 April 2013 (CEST)
</p><p>F) Cruel arrangement: a minivault island at D:21. The only door lays behind deep water and - surprise - reveals a <a href="/Silver_statue" title="Silver statue">silver statue</a> in the chamber center. Lots and lots of summoned <a href="/Demon" title="Demon">demons</a> of all tiers - if you are not happy and smart enough to carry a <a href="/Wand_of_disintegration" class="mw-redirect" title="Wand of disintegration">wand of disintegration</a>. Secret doors lead to another two silver statues. Alas, wands of disintegration are rare and scrolls of recharging as well. Now the last door: an <a href="/Ancient_lich" title="Ancient lich">Ancient lich</a> (sleeping!) guards the treasure: the <a href="/Ring_of_the_Mage" title="Ring of the Mage">ring of the Mage</a>, an unrandart. My MfGl of Makhleb XL18 is very uneasy to battle such an endgame opponent now?. Later. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 23:12, 6 May 2013 (CEST)  
</p>
<dl><dd>I think one of the most important lessons of this game is to not kill every monster that enters your line of sight. Many times, the best decision is to skip a level or vault. In this particular case, you can just lure the lich outside of the vault and steal the ring. --<a href="/User:CommanderC" title="User:CommanderC">CommanderC</a> 00:33, 7 May 2013 (CEST)
<dl><dd>Much better solution I found. As I had high stealth of 9,5 and the apportation spell I managed to open the door without wakening the Lich (GOOD luck!) and steal the ring without combat! Got away with it. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 15:50, 7 May 2013 (CEST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>G) I played an artificer and thought it harmless to use my base chaos wand in a closed area on a simple worm. But what a surpise: The worm evaporates and reforms as a steam dragon! His breathing brought a quick death. Never had I imagined that a worm could have the same base Dice like a small dragon. So I had to learn it. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 15:39, 20 May 2013 (CEST)
</p><p>H) Began as a Lava Orc Artificer in 0.13a online Aug 2013. Ended XL7 mangled by a shadow (30 damage)! ... on Level 11 of the Dungeon. Hadn't known that the recently boosted trunk <a href="/Shadow" title="Shadow">Shadow</a> got such massive damage AND invisiblity at the same time. Some developers seem to have weird imaginations about *balanced* early game playing. BTW I saw in the morgue log: "D:4: uniq_edmund, uniq_sigmund, uniq_eustachio, uniq_menkaure, uniq_grinder". Some versions ago it was not yet allowed to have more than two uniques in early Dungeeon levels. Nobody can call this seriously "balanced"!

<p>I've finally done the step to have an account on CDO. Have to try it out, maybe take part on the tournament.

<p>Hey Bwijn, I looked at the morgue of your MfTm, and I noticed you trained a lot of unnecessary skills. Did you just leave it on auto? This might seem easier at first, but it helps your character tremendously if you set it to manual and only train the most relevant skills, in this case UC, Transmutations and a some spellcasting --<a href="/User:Lokkij" title="User:Lokkij">Lokkij</a> 18:44, 11 May 2013 (CEST)
</p>
<dl><dd>No, I don't think that most are unnecessary. Stealth and evasion training saves your neck. High stabbing skill (I know that 0.13-trunk has kicked it out) makes sure that you can finish those basilisks and hill giants later on. Traps awareness is vital. To train Spellcasting is necessary to reduce spell hunger. Well, I admit that several weapon proficiencies or spell schools are not necessary. But as the chances what spellbook or highquality weapon you randomly   find are so unpredictible, some trainings are more or less wrong placed. Ashenzari permits to readapt those. - And no, I'm not a fan of the proposed "manual" adjustments. I dislike that philosophy! -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 23:22, 11 May 2013 (CEST)
<dl><dd>I will agree that some of those are quite useful, but you don't have to train them all right from the start. What I usually do is train Stealth up to level 4 or so at the very beginning (that's usually good enough to start with, and you can always add more later); I leave off training Traps until I hit the Lair, where I get it up to around 8-ish and then add more as needed afterwards. Generally, I avoid training Stabbing unless I'm using Short Blades; otherwise, the bonus damage tends not to be worth it unless you get it to really high levels, and the experience is better spent elsewhere for Transmuters. Also, Transmuters really shouldn't do much with weapons -- a MfTm might maybe make use of a flaming short blade to hack off hydra heads, or a weapon of electrocution to deal with heavily armored threats, but that's only if you find either of those things.</dd>
<dd>The bulk of my MfTm's experience always goes into things like Fighting, Unarmed Combat, Dodging, Spellcasting, Transmutations, and whatever other spell schools are necessary (a few levels of Poison Magic for Spider Form, for example). Using manual mode is a really good way of making sure all your experience goes to where you want it to go, and that you don't add more to a skill after you have it high enough. Also, the more skills you train at once, the slower they grow; if you overspecialize too much at the start, you might not be strong enough to handle the bigger threats later on. <a href="/User:Spudwalt" title="User:Spudwalt">--spudwalt</a> 05:48, 12 May 2013 (CEST)
<dl><dd>Hey spudwalt, I also looked at the morgue of your <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://crawl.akrasiac.org/rawdata/spudwalt/morgue-spudwalt-20130512-051220.txt">XL11 DgEE</a>, and (in my opinion) you also need to focus your skills a bit more&nbsp;:). Spellcaster generally only focus on weapons later in the game, and your focus should always be at your primary magic school. 6 Earth Magic at XL11 is not a lot to be honest, and fighting, dodging and shields aren't necessary until later, so you could've put that XP into earth magic, which would probably make petrify and LRD castable, and increased power on the other earth spells. I understand you also want those spells in those shiny spellbooks you found, but few high-power spells &gt; a lot of low-power spells. Although I will say, blink is really nice to have, and flame tongue for training fire magic isn't bad either. Oh, and more spellcasting would've made stone arrow hungerless (== spammable). But maybe it's just style of play I'm not used to&nbsp;:) --<a href="/User:Lokkij" title="User:Lokkij">Lokkij</a> 18:34, 12 May 2013 (CEST)
<dl><dd>It's more of a play-style thing -- I tend to prefer hybrid characters rather than pure spellcasters, since spellcasters have huge problems when they run out of MP and I <i>really</i> hate having to run away to recharge MP. And yeah, maybe it's not ideal, but I did manage to get a DgEE to Zot:5 before dying from stupidity (and my skills were even less focused then), so it can work. <a href="/User:Spudwalt" title="User:Spudwalt">--spudwalt</a> 22:30, 19 May 2013 (CEST)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Really, trust me. It may look stupid/dumb/not fun at first, but it really does help your characters get deeper into the dungeon when you only train your weapon skill/spell schools in the beginning. Just try it for a while, and if you really dislike it, you can always switch back&nbsp;:) --<a href="/User:Lokkij" title="User:Lokkij">Lokkij</a> 15:31, 12 May 2013 (CEST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Oh, and do you usually go down the first staircase you see, or do you clear the whole level first? I saw you killed very little monsters in your recent games.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diary_and_Observations_on_0.12.1_online">Diary and Observations on 0.12.1 online</span></h2>
<p>A) More "shafts" needed and less bottlenecks! I've lost several avatars because of the "three stairs at the same place" arrangement feature. If strong monsters or even uniques block the one and only(!) way - as it happended to me much too frequently - this setting is a perfect death-trap. Sometimes you can get around such a bottleneck by using a shaft trap which bypasses whole dungeon-levels. But much too often shafts are completely  missing. Why isn't it possible to produce your own shafts with a wand of digging? - Surely those death-trap bottlenecks are not new in 0.12. But the "randomization" has become fake(!) and much more harsh. In 0.11 and worse even in 0.12 the items to be found are less and less generous. Very few rings in the first levels and those mostly of poorest quality (e.g. ring of evasion+2). But remember: even a cursed ring of teleportation could help you out of a death trap in emergency cases. But even scrolls of teleportation and blinking are much too rare! -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 23:01, 11 May 2013 (CEST)
</p>
<dl><dd>I think that's more just a run of bad luck on your part. A great many of your characters will ultimately get killed by bad luck in the early game, such as running into powerful monsters or the game generating dangerous floor layouts. I don't even know how many characters I've run (probably at least 2000 by now), but only <b>ONE</b> of them ever managed to get out with the Orb. A few more of them might have made it, but all of them died because I made bad choices and didn't run away when I should have. I'm not sure what the success rate of accomplished players is, but I'd be willing to bet even the best players only win with one out of every twenty characters. Like most roguelikes out there, <i>Crawl</i> is not intended to be anywhere remotely close to easy.</dd>
<dd>In cases of dangerous rooms where all the staircases are in one place, escape hatches down from the previous floor (if they're present, but they tend to be more common than shafts) have a decent chance of getting you around the dangerous area. Then you gradually can lure things away from the stairs and clear them out without getting horribly swarmed.</dd>
<dd>Also, the lack of jewellery and useful scrolls in the early portions of the game sounds about average. Yeah, it's <i>possible</i> to find a cool ring or multiple scrolls of teleportation and/or blinking on the first few floors, but that's quite rare. Admittedly, I've only been playing since 0.10, but rings and escape scrolls have almost never been really common in the early game. <a href="/User:Spudwalt" title="User:Spudwalt">--spudwalt</a> 06:07, 12 May 2013 (CEST)</dd>

<dl><dd>Okay, mates, thanks for consolation intentions. I've never played online Crawl before May 2013 and my tournament results up to now were not heart warming. But nevertheless I'm not willing to bore with complaints. - I know quite well, it was a mix of bad luck and wrong decisions. Sometimes I'd wish the game updates to be more open, fair and humorous, less sadistic. E.g. to dig your own shafts when needed even if the downfall costs hitpoints would be great. But sure I'm learning to survive and get better results even while struggling in 0.12 conditions. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> 21:07, 12 May 2013 (CEST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="online_disruptions">online disruptions</span></h3>
<p>It's not the number of stupid deaths that speak against online DCSS playing but the constantly high rate of having to reload CAO. Absolutely unnerving! In extreme moments it's 3 times in 2 minutes. Maybe it's more a problem of the tiles and of course the far distance server on the other continent? Do the console artists like Flun and CommanderC have less disruptions and much more flow in their game experience? - If not for the tournament I'd never chosen to try it out. Even if now it's hard sometimes to find out that you're more a beginner than you'd thought. No Save cheating ever makes it another game! The player ghosts are no fun in my eyes.

<p>The taking part in the tournament is indeed a very efficient means to pull people into the next set of changed rules and monsters. Without it I would stay much longer in old versions I'm accustomed to.

</p><p>My thumbs down:
</p>
<ul><li> 14: Monsters no longer avoid walking on shadow traps. (0.16.1)</li>
<li> 28: Every time a player clears a ziggurat (exits from the top floor, Zig:27), all subsequent ziggurats become significantly harder.</li>
<li> 112: Player ghosts &amp; spellforged servitors can now have more than six spells.</li>
<li> 161: Zapping wands that don't have their charge count identified wastes several charges.</li>
<li> 205: Large rocks no longer have randomized range.</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="0.18_poison_needles">0.18 poison needles</span></h2>
<p>Hi, you partially reverted my edit on <a href="/Needle" title="Needle">needle</a> and added back that poison needles are helpful in the early game. But because their effects only scale with throwing in 0.18, they're really only helpful with some throwing. It's pretty hard to kill things like ogres and orc warriors now with poison needles and no throwing skill, and those used to be prime targets.
</p><p>I'd ask you to try actually using poison needles in 0.18 and reconsider. <a href="/User:Edsrzf" title="User:Edsrzf">Edsrzf</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Edsrzf" title="User talk:Edsrzf">talk</a>) 21:45, 6 May 2016 (CEST)
</p>
<dl><dd>Well, I still think you did too much clean up there. *IF* you were really right about *nearly non-effects* of blowguns this weapon would be of no use any longer. I can't assume that. Ogres have so little Hp that those needles will still help softening them up. OTOH the new version is still so new that no serious testiing judgement is possible. Although I'm not happy with this version's developers in reducing needles and other decisions I'm not taking them for complete fools. And you have to train 'throwing' in order to become skilled, and you have to begin in early game. I know quite well that throwing stones is not very effectful in base levels. Okay, I will test the fact in question. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 15:13, 7 May 2016 (CEST)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A_very_special_0.18.1_hazard_story">A very special 0.18.1 hazard story</span></h2>
<p>While playing a HOFi I got a splendid randart scale armour which reduced Int by -2 and another randart, a ring {*Drain rElec rC+++ MP+9 Int-3}. Okawaru was pleased w/ my combat style, even made me his champion. But one of his gifts made my throat very narrow: the randart hat (which I identified by equipping) had another -5 INT -&gt; <b>reducing me to -1 INT but indeed not killing me</b>. I did see the status 'brainless' for a short time, just before I removed the unfitting artifact hat and OMFSM! the INT normalized above danger level. Another detail makes survival even more uneasy: I've got a bad mutation called 'deterioration 1' which reduces stats temporaily upon taking damage. And I evolve fast -&gt; a (very small) probabilty that I could lose -2 INT randomly. Now I'm very keen on finding out if survival is happening even in the first rune winning fights of mid game. -- <a href="/User:Bwijn" title="User:Bwijn">Bwijn</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:48, 26 September 2016 (CEST)
